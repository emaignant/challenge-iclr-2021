    "David G. Kendall first took interest into triangular shapes while studying random alignments of points in archeology and related fields [[KK1980]](#References). Following this statistical study, he developped the more general theory of shapes. This theory echoes in many fields like biology, medicine, or image analysis, where the shape of an object is particularly relevant when it comes to its analysis. Since the deformation of a shape is not necessarely linear, we need to use geometric statistics in order to proceed with such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kendall theory, the word shape is used in the common sense, refering to the appearance of an object. Since the shape of an object should not depend on the way it is looked at or computed, it is natural to remove location, rotationnal and eventually scale effects. A practical way of describing an object's shape is to locate a finite number of relevant points on it, which we call landmarks, which should summarize the geometrical and/or scientifical information [[DM2016]](#References). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we define Kendall shape space of order $(k,m)$ (where $k\\geq 2$) as the quotient of $k$-tuples of non-aligned points in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ by the group of rotations, translations and dilatations of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ :  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\big(\\Sigma^k_m\\triangleq\\mathbb{R}^{km}\\setminus \\Delta \\big)/\\big(\\mathbb{R_+^*}\\times SO(m)\\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^m\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta =\\{\\ (a)_{1\\leq i\\leq k}\\ |\\ a\\in\\mathbb{R}^m\\}$ correspond to the degenerate case where all landmarks collapse into a unique point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to see that considering first the action of translations and dilatations before applying rotation group $\\text{SO}$ allows to write :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Sigma^k_m=\\mathcal{S}^k_m/ \\text{SO}(m)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{S}^k_m$, called the pre-shape space of order $(k,m)$ denotes the space of centered and normalized $k$-tuples of in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. It corresponds to the unit sphere of dimension $k(m-1)$ [[K1984]](#References).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kendall shape space of order $(k,m)$ is a differential manifold which acquires singularities as soon as $m\\geq 3$. Apart from these singularities, it is a smooth manifold which can be equipped with a Riemannian metric inherited from the Frobenius metric on the pre-shape space [[LK1993]](#References). "

These isometries can be computed explicitely, and therefore allow us to visualize directly the two Kendall shape spaces.\n",
